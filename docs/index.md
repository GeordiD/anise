# Anise

Anise is a meal planning app, powered by AI.

Features:

- Store recipes that have been saved and curated by the user
- Display the recipes in a consistent, easy to parse format
- Track what food is available in the house to be used for recipes
- Generate potential meal plans based on what scheduled activities we have, what food we have in the house, and what we're feeling
  - This could generate a full plan, or fill in the gaps of an existing plan with ideas
- Connect to Kroger to see what items are available and make a shopping list

## Current State

Right now, nothing has been built. We are going to build this.

## Tech

We should be preferring these technologies

  - If needed, we can use Nuxt if we need a more robust platform
- TypeScript

- LLMs - I have an OpenRouter account
