# Initial Plan for Anise Meal Planning App

## Phase 1: Project Foundation & Setup
1. **Initialize Nuxt project** with TypeScript and Vue 3 (full-stack approach for fast iteration)
2. **Set up Nuxt UI** for component library and consistent design system
3. **Configure Drizzle ORM** with PGlite for local development database
4. **Set up development environment** following your TS starter preferences:
   - pnpm as package manager
   - ESLint configuration with Nuxt standards
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - Future: husky pre-commit hooks
5. **Create basic project structure** with pages, server API routes, and database schema

## Phase 2: MVP Core Features (Simplified)
1. **Recipe Management**: Basic CRUD operations for recipes with ingredients and instructions
2. **Pantry Tracking**: Add/remove/edit pantry items with quantities

## Future Phases (Not Implemented Yet)
- Meal planning with AI integration
- Shopping list generation
- Advanced features

## Technology Decisions
- **Framework**: Nuxt 4 (full-stack Vue 3 + TypeScript)
- **UI Library**: @nuxt/ui for components and design system
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM + PGlite (dev) â†’ PostgreSQL (prod)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Tooling**: @nuxt/eslint, Prettier, TypeScript

## Implementation Notes
- Start with Phase 1 foundation
- Keep MVP simple and focused
- Build incrementally with proper testing
